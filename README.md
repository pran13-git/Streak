# Streak
### tl;dr - A connect-4 type game with a lot more fun and customisation!

### Long story:

Streak is a two-player connection game in which the
players, denoted by their numbers, take turns
placing their colored numbered tokens in the
lowest available space in each column of the grid. The grid is of different sizes
for various difficulty modes. It has a size of 8x8 for Novice Easy mode, 9x9 for
Amateur Medium and 10x10 for Pro Hard. The objective of the game is to be
the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of one's own tokens. This
streak of tokens would have to contain 4 for the Novice Easy mode, 5 for the
Amateur Medium mode and 6 for the Pro Hard mode. Each player also has an
individual time limit of 200 seconds for playing all their moves. If a player runs
out of time, the other player is automatically declared as the winner.
